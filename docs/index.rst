About this software
-------------------
The DCA tool is built with flexibility in mind, allowing you to specify your own schedule of buying and withdrawing. A few examples that are possible:

* Buy each week, never withdraw.
* Buy monthly and withdraw at the same time to reduce exchange risk.
* Buy each week but withdraw only at the end of the month to save on withdrawal fees.
