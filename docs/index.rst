About this software
-------------------
This self-hosted DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) tool is built with flexibility in mind, allowing you to specify your schedule for buying and withdrawing.

A few examples of possible scenario's:

* Buy each week, never withdraw;
* Buy monthly and withdraw at the same time to reduce exchange risk;
* Buy each week but withdraw only at the end of the month to save on withdrawal fees.
