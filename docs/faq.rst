I already have MyNode running, can I use this tool too?
-------------------------------------------------------

Yes! MyNode is based on Linux and has Docker already installed. You can use all features of Bitcoin DCA.

Things you should keep in mind: The default user, ``admin`` doesn't have permission to run Docker by default.

See :ref:`getting-started` for more information.
