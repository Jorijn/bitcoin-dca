I already have MyNode / Umbrel running, can I use this tool too?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Yes! MyNode and Umbrel are both based on Linux and have Docker pre-installed. You can use all features of Bitcoin DCA.

Things you should keep in mind: The default user doesn't have permission to run Docker by default. MyNode uses user ``admin`` and Umbrel uses ``umbrel``.

See :ref:`getting-started` for more information.
