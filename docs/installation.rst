Installation
============

.. include:: ./includes/beta_warning.rst

Requirements
------------
* You need to have an account on BL3P: https://bl3p.eu/.
* You need to have Docker installed: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
* You need to have an API key active on BL3P. Create one here: https://bl3p.eu/security. It needs **read**, **trade** and **withdraw** permission. For safety, I would recommend locking the API key to the IP address you are planning on running this tool from.
