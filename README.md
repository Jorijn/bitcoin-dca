## Requirements
* You need to have an account on a supported exchange;
* You need to have Docker installed: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/;
* You need to have an API key active on a supported exchange. It needs **read**, **trade** and **withdraw** permission.

## Supported Exchanges
| Exchange | URL | Currencies | XPUB withdraw supported |
|------|------|------|------|
| BL3P | https://bl3p.eu/ | EUR | Yes |
| Bitvavo | https://bitvavo.com/ | EUR | No * |
| Kraken | https://kraken.com/ | USD EUR CAD JPY GBP CHF AUD | No |
| Binance | https://binance.com/ | USDT BUSD EUR USDC USDT GBP AUD TRY BRL DAI TUSD RUB UAH PAX BIDR NGN IDRT VAI | Yes |

\* Due to regulatory changes in The Netherlands, Bitvavo currently requires you to provide proof of address ownership, thus temporarily disabling Bitcoin-DCA's XPUB feature.

## About this software
The DCA tool is built with flexibility in mind, allowing you to specify your schedule of buying and withdrawing. A few examples that are possible:

* Buy each week, never withdraw.
* Buy monthly and withdraw at the same time to reduce exchange risk.
* Buy each week but withdraw only at the end of the month to save on withdrawal fees.
